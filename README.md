This application creates a password for the user. The user is prompted to enter the desired length of their password, as long as it stays between 8 and 128 characters. After this, they are asked if they would like lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or symbols included. Once they have let the application know this information, a randomly generated password is then displayed.
